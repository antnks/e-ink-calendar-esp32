The most complicated part was to get all the electronic parts together.
The display requires a specific driver board which is only sold by Waveshare and can only be ordered by directly inquiring sales. Then the [wiki page](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/12.48inch_e-Paper_Module_(B)) incorrectly specifies that the cable is 24-pin. It is not. It is 30-pin. Waveshare sent wrong cables twice. After that I realized that you cannot fit a standard ESP32 dev module into the driver board, because Waveshare made it incompatible (different size and two pins swapped), you must order a special Waveshare braded ESP32 board.

It took 6 months for me to get all the needed parts. If you decide to assemble this project, I recommend you to get a module set which includes everything you need.
